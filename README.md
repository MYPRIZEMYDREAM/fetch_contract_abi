## A program to fetch the contract abi of a smart contract and save it in json format

I have created this program to fetch the contract abi of a smart contract and save it in json format.

As I encountered this issue while working on a project. And I just decided to publish this repository to help someone out there that might need this.

To make use of the script just clone using
```
git clone 
```
    
    Then run the script using
    ```
    python3 fetch_abi.py
    ```
    You'll be required to enter the contract address which you
    want to fetch the abi of. You can get this from the etherscan.io website.
